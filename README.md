# 365-Days-of-Bio-AI
My 365-day journey learning Python for Bio-AI Engineering
Day 1: Environment setup and starting Python for Everybody

Day 2: Understood the input and output via MIT webite and also understood that computers dont understand like we humans do instead they need clear step by step instructions. I also understood that strings is just a fancy word given for a group of characters

Day 3:
Logic Flip:
“Then” and “Else” are like two different paths. If you mix them up, you’ll go the wrong way.
Variables vs Constants:
“Apple” stays the same all the time (constant).
“Answer” can change and hold different values (variable).

Day 4:
Loops:
Understood the difference between fixed loop,Conditional loop,Infinite loop

Loop = logical automation of repetition.

A fixed loop stops after fixed number of repetitions whereas a conditional loop stops only when the the result mismatches the given  condition whereas infinite loop is like the condition never goes wrong so the computer continues the same loop Infinite times

Day 5:
